# Rich Terminal Rendering

Tmuxy intercepts terminal escape sequences that would otherwise be passed through to (or dropped by) tmux and renders them as real DOM elements. The browser shows actual `<a>` for hyperlinks, `<img>` for inline images, and clipboard requests round-trip through `navigator.clipboard`.

This document covers what's supported, how the pipeline works, and how to test each protocol.

## Supported protocols

| Protocol | DCS / OSC / APC | Backend | Frontend | Notes |
|----------|----------------|---------|----------|-------|
| **OSC 8 — Hyperlinks** | `ESC ] 8 ; … ; <url> ST` | `control_mode/osc.rs` (style on cell) | `TerminalLine.tsx` → `<a href>` | Parsed from the control-mode stream; no `terminal-features` setting needed |
| **OSC 1337 — iTerm2 Inline Images** | `ESC ] 1337 ; File=… : <base64> BEL` | `control_mode/images.rs::try_parse_iterm2` | `Terminal.tsx` → `<img src="/api/images/…">` | Base64 of any browser-renderable format |
| **APC _G — Kitty Graphics** | `ESC _ G <keys> ; <payload> ESC \` | `control_mode/images.rs::try_parse_kitty` | same | Supports chunked transfer (`m=1`/`m=0`) and formats `f=24`/`f=32`/`f=100` |
| **DCS Pq — Sixel** | `ESC P q … ESC \` | `control_mode/images.rs::try_parse_sixel` | same | Decoded by `icy_sixel`, re-encoded as PNG before serving |
| **OSC 52 — Clipboard** | `ESC ] 52 ; c ; <base64> ST` | `control_mode/osc.rs` parser → `StateEmitter::write_clipboard` → SSE `clipboard` event (web) / `tmux-clipboard` (Tauri) | `TmuxAdapter.onClipboard` → `TMUX_CLIPBOARD` event → `navigator.clipboard.writeText` in appMachine | Outbound only — pasting back is not implemented. Storybook coverage: `App/Resilience > ClipboardOSC52`. |

OSC 8 has been supported for a long time. The image protocols landed together with the OSC 52 parser — all parsing lives in `tmuxy-core/src/control_mode/images.rs` and `tmuxy-core/src/control_mode/osc.rs` — but only the SSE `clipboard` event + `TMUX_CLIPBOARD` plumbing finished the round-trip into `navigator.clipboard.writeText`. On the frontend, `Terminal.tsx` renders image placements and `TerminalLine.tsx` renders hyperlink cells.

## How tmux preserves the sequences

Tmuxy speaks **tmux control mode** (`-CC`), and tmux forwards every escape sequence the running application emits inside `%output` events on stdout. That includes passthrough payloads. Earlier versions of this document claimed image escapes were stripped — that was wrong. The Rust parser sits on top of the control-mode byte stream and never needs to touch the pty directly.

Two tmux options matter:

- `set -g allow-passthrough on` — required so tmux doesn't refuse to relay the sequences. The monitor sets this automatically on every session at connect time (see `sync_initial_state` in `tmuxy-core/src/control_mode/monitor.rs`).
- `set -g default-terminal "tmux-256color"` (or another terminfo entry that does **not** include image capabilities) — keeps tmux from trying to act on the sequences itself.

The parser is permissive about line wrapping and stray printable bytes between chunked Kitty packets, since tmux re-flows output around its own column wrapping.

## End-to-end pipeline

```
running app
   │ writes escape bytes
   ▼
tmux (-CC, passthrough)
   │ wraps as %output %<pane> <bytes>
   ▼
tmuxy-core / control_mode/parser.rs
   │ feeds raw payload to
   ▼
control_mode/images.rs::ImageParser::process
   │ ─► extracts payload, decodes, stores image bytes in pane state
   │ ─► returns ImageProcessResult { stripped: bytes_to_render,
   │                                  new_placements: [(id, StoredImage)…] }
   ▼
ServerPane.images  (snake_case, serialized over SSE)
   │
   ▼
appMachine.helpers::transformServerState  (snake → camel via camelize())
   │
   ▼
TmuxPane.images : ImagePlacement[]
   │
   ▼
TerminalPane.tsx → Terminal.tsx
   │ renders <img class="terminal-image"
   │              src="/api/images/<paneNum>/<imageId>"
   │              data-protocol="iterm2|kitty|sixel"
   │              style="top: …; left: …; width: …; height: …" />
   ▼
GET /api/images/{pane_id}/{image_id}
   │ served by tmuxy-server (see api_routes in state.rs)
   ▼
stored bytes (already in the format the browser expects: PNG/JPEG/WebP)
```

`ImageParser` keeps the raw bytes per `(pane_id, image_id)` so that re-renders, viewport changes, and reconnects all read the same content. Sixel input is converted to PNG once at parse time so the server doesn't repeat the decode on every fetch.

## Placement geometry

Each `ImagePlacement` carries:

- `id` — monotonic per-pane image counter, matches the URL path
- `row`, `col` — top-left cell coordinates within the pane grid
- `width_cells`, `height_cells` — bounding box in terminal cells
- `protocol` — one of `iterm2`, `kitty`, `sixel`

The frontend positions the `<img>` absolutely inside `.terminal-images` using `calc(<n> * var(--cell-width|height))`, so the image stays anchored to the same cell range as the surrounding text reflows. When `width=auto` / `height=auto` is requested, the parser converts pixels to cells using the pane's current cell size estimate.

**Known limitation — placements are viewport-cell anchored, not content-tracked.** The `row`/`col` anchor is the cursor position at decode time and never moves afterwards: the core's vt100 emulator runs with zero scrollback, so there is no scroll signal to shift placements when later output scrolls the screen. An image therefore stays pinned to its original viewport cell while text scrolls underneath it (iTerm2, by contrast, scrolls images with content). Content-tracked placements would require a scrolled-lines counter in the vt100 layer plus row adjustment and off-screen culling in `control_mode/images.rs`. The `ImageAnchoredDuringScroll` story guards the current anchored behavior.

## Testing

### Manual

```bash
# OSC 8 hyperlink
printf '\e]8;;https://example.com\e\\Click me\e]8;;\e\\\n'
ls --hyperlink=auto

# iTerm2 inline image (requires `imgcat` from iTerm2 utilities, or any
# tool that emits OSC 1337 File=…)
imgcat path/to/image.png

# Kitty graphics protocol
kitten icat path/to/image.png   # the official client
# or any application using zellij / ranger's kitty image preview

# Sixel
img2sixel path/to/image.png
chafa --format sixel path/to/image.png
```

Inside a real tmuxy session, each of these renders the image inline in the pane.

### Automated

- **Rust unit tests** (`tmuxy-core/src/control_mode/images.rs`) cover the parsers and placement geometry — including chunked Kitty transfers, RGBA-to-PNG conversion, and Sixel decode.
- **Storybook interaction tests** in `tmuxy-ui/src/components/ImageProtocols.stories.tsx` use the demo adapter's `tmuxy-image-attach` helper to inject placements and verify the rendered `<img>` element (one story per protocol plus a multi-protocol story and a split-pane story). The byte source is stubbed via `window.__tmuxyImageSrc`.
- **E2E** runs a real tmux session, emits each protocol with a shell command, and asserts the `<img>` shows up in the page (see `tests/`).

## Other rich-rendering opportunities

These are documented because they reuse the same passthrough pipeline; whether to implement them is a product decision, not a technical one.

- **OSC 9 / OSC 777 — Desktop notifications**
- **OSC 9;4 — ConEmu progress bars**
- **OSC 133 — FinalTerm semantic zones** (prompt / command / output markers)
- **OSC 7 — Working-directory hints** (already partially wired for tab titles)
